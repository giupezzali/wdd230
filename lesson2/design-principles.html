            <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>

            <p>The Drumeo website design uses a visual hierarchy. Even when it has a lot of things
                inside its content, the most important it is clearly defined. In the example above,
                we saw that the phrase "Learn to play the drums with the best teachers in the world"
                is the focal point, then the button "get started" invites the user to visit the page,
                continue with a paragraph explaining what they're offering, and finally an illustrative
                image. They order the elements by using different sizes, colors, and contrast.</p>

            <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>

            <p>The Bank of the Argentine Nation design uses the rule of thirds.
                In the image above, we see they place the most important information near the upper-left
                side to assure that the client will see it first. After that, the viewer will see the bottom-left,
                to know more about them, and finally, the principal element in the image to the right side to create
                a balanced design.</p>

            <h3>PARC: Contrast</h3>

            <img src="images/lds_mobile.jpg" alt="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints mobile view screenshot">
            <p>In The Church of Jesus Christ design, we will be paying attention to the contrast. In the example above, 
            we have a title inside an image. The text is placed at the bottom, away from the lighter color of the image, 
            and the font's color is white, helping the readability and comprehension of the message. Visually, it focuses
            on the text, and the contrast affirms that hierarchy.</p>
